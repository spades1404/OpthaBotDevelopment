Hello!

So you managed to successfully install the software. Here is what you do next.

When you first launch the program you will encounter a setup screen, here you will link your copy of the software to a practice. I should have given you your own login details for this practice, keep those handy. Click "Setup Existing Practice"Raj

Your link code is APOLLO , the name of your practice is Artemis Optical

Now, you should be able to login with your credentials!


So what now? At the home screen you can upload your own scans, we recommend using the examples provided in the ExamplePic folder. You can create your own patients or edit existing ones. You can see previous scans people have uploaded. 

It wont take too long for you to find any niggling bugs still remaining, so if you come accross one - let me know and ill try fix it.

There are a few known bugs, the biggest one being some small graphical issues, such as entry box text being slightly off. The fixes for this are being worked on.

Enjoy!
